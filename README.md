## 2022 CDC West Nile virus Forecasting Challenge

This is the data repository for the 2022 CDC West Nile virus Forecasting Challenge. This is an _**open**_ 
forecasting challenge to predict West Nile virus (WNV) neuroinvasive disease cases in U.S. counties during the 2022 
calendar year.


### Participation
To participate in the Challenge, please follow these steps:
1. [Request WNV data](./data-surveillance/README.md) by sending a signed Data Use 
Agreement to <vbd-predict@cdc.gov>.
2. Prepare [metadata](./data-forecasts/README.md#Data-formatting) for your model.
3. [Submit the forecast](./data-forecasts/README.md#Making-a-submission) by the deadlines.

For information on submitting forecasts to this project, please see the 
[submission instructions](./data-forecasts/README.md). Participating teams provide their 
[forecasts](./data-forecasts/) in a [quantile-based format](./data-forecasts/README.md#Data-formatting) that will
be evaluated according to [these criteria](./Evaluation.md). 

### Timeline
- Project announcement and historical data release: Winter 2022.
- Initial forecast due: April 30, 2022.
- Additional forecasts due (optional): May 31, June 30, and July 31, 2022.


## Background
[West Nile virus](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html) (WNV) is the leading cause of arboviral disease in the 
contiguous United States. An estimated 70–80% of WNV infections are asymptomatic; 20‒30% of infected persons 
develop an acute systemic febrile illness and <1% of infected persons develop neuroinvasive disease (e.g., 
meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis). Among patients with neuroinvasive disease, the case-fatality ratio is 
approximately 10%. Due to its severity and distinctive clinical features, diagnosis and reporting of neuroinvasive 
disease is considered more consistent and complete than that of non-neuroinvasive disease.

The first cases of WNV disease in the United States were identified in New York City in 1999; the virus 
subsequently spread westward, reaching the Pacific coast in 2003. Since then, WNV has caused seasonal summer 
outbreaks that vary in size and location, with most areas having sporadic disease or intermittent outbreaks. No 
vaccine or specific treatment of WNV is currently available. Reducing mosquito exposure through vector control and 
personal protective behaviors are the primary forms of prevention. Predicting where and when WNV transmission will 
occur could help direct control efforts.


## Data license and reuse
We are grateful to the teams who have generated these forecasts and made their forecast data publicly available under different terms 
and licenses. By default, forecasts are available under the CC-BY 4.0 license, although teams may specify release 
under a different license in their metadata. You will find the licenses (when provided) within the metadata 
contained within model-specific folders in the [data-forecasts](./data-forecasts/) directory. Please consult these 
licenses before using these data to ensure that you follow the terms under which these data were released.
