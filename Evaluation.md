Evaluation
------------------

When reported data for 2022 are available, an analysis will be conducted using the average logarithmic score to assess and compare forecasts across all 
counties at each time point. A joint manuscript will be prepared to disseminate findings on this comparison and 
the general performance of submitted forecasts. Participants may publish their own forecasts and results at any time.

### Logarithmic Score

Each quantile forecast will be fitted to a negative binomial distribution and the probability of the observed outcome, *x*, 
will be calculated from the probability mass function, *p*, of the fitted negative binonmial distribution. The corresponding logarithmic score is therefore:

> S(p, x) = ln(p(x))

Logarithmic scores below -10 will be assigned a value of -10.
