methods:  For this challenge, we used a fixed-effect Poisson regression model to fit our model using temperature, precipitation, last year mean cases of neighbors and past two years' cumulative cases.
data_inputs: Temperature which is the average temperature for each county per year (2000 to 2022, same years for the forecats) during each month (from ncdc), Precipitation which is the average precipitation for each county per year (2000 to 2022, same years for the forecats) during each month (from ncdc), Mean cases of each county neighbors for the previous year, Cumulative cases of each county for the past two years.
