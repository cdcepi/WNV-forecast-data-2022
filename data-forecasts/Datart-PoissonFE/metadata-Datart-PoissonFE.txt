### methods
Since there is not any linear trend in the number of cases through years, linear models may not be a good option. For this challenge, we used a Poisson regression to fit our model.
Since we are interested in changes during the years, we performed a fixed effect Poisson regression model. Our dependent variable is count (number of cases per county per year) and 
our independent variables are average temperature, average precipitation, mean cases of neighbors of each county for the previous year, and cumulative cases of each county for the 
past two years. Our fixed effect Poisson regression model can be represented in the following equation:
y = β0 + β1 X average_temperature ∗ X average_precipitation + β2 X past_year_of neighbors’_mean_cases + β3 Xpast_2_years_of_county′s_cumulative_cases + ε
