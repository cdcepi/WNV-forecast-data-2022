methods: County-Level Bayesian Poisson regression with a log-link function using R-INLA
data_inputs: Water and forest data were obtained on the county scale from the national land cover database. Vector data were obtained through the Defense Technical Information Center, Population data was obtained through the US Census Bureau, and elevation data were obtained from the USGS DEM 100-Meter Resolution Elevation of the Conterminuous United States
methods_long: Predictions were calculated using a Bayesian Poisson regression with a log-link function. Predictors chosen for the final model included the population of individuals aged 65 and up in each county, the presence/absence of the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito, average county elevation in feet, the percent of each county which is forested, time variables to account for oscillating cycles in West Nile Virus cases, and year.  As West Nile Virus cases tend to exhibit a three-year cycle of increase and decrease, indicator variables for cycle-year (cycle year 1, cycle year 2, or cycle year 3 (reference level) were included in the model. Because the effect of time varied across regions, we used random effects to allow the coefficients for year to be county-specific. Specifically, these coefficients followed a conditional auto-regressive model at the county level. For the offset term of our regression, we used the log of the county population. An integrated nested LaPlace approximation (INLA) model in R software was used to fit our model. This provided a faster way to fit our model than standard Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
