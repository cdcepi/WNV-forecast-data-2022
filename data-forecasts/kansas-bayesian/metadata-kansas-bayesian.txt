methods_long: "A two-part Bayesian hierarchical model was developed\
  \  The model includes spatial and temporal \
  \ effects as well as spatially varying coefficients (SVC) for climate factors to enable location-specific \
  \ estimation of climatic influence.  Avian host phylodiversity, virus surveilance, and economic variables were added as predictors."
