team_model_designation: primary
methods: Random forest predictions based on historical temperature anomaly data.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: NOAA GlobalTemp dataset of temperature anomalies.
methods_long: For each location, we used center coordinates to extract values of monthly temperature anomalies. These were used as covariates, and case numbers were used as predictors when training random forest model. For prediction, we bootstraped historical values of monthly temperature anomalies for each location as predators for 2022.
