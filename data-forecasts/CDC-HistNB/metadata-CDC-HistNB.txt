team_model_designation: primary
methods: Quantiles from county-specific negative binomial fit to 2000-2021 historical WNV data.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: No variables included.
methods_long: This is a baseline model. We used the historical WNV (2000-2021) counts for each county to fit a county-specific negative binomial distribution. We then calculated the quantiles for each county from the fitted negative binomial.
