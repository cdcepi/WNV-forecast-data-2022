team_model_designation: primary
methods: "Modulation function for the estimate of the mosquito relative density combined with the probability of observing
  West Nile transmission events assessed throughout a logistic regression model"
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: "Monthly precipitation and temperature records were retrieved from the WorldClim database at a spatial resolution \
  \ of 30 seconds. Specifically, these records are the average for the years 1970-2000. Data on the human density were retrieved \
  \ from the JRC Earth Observation Data and Processing Platform at a spatial resolution of 250 m x 250 m. We use mosquito capture \
  \ data collected in different locations of the US."
methods_long: "We assess the probability of observing West Nile transmission events by applying an ensemble of nested logistic \
  \ regression models to records of viral occurrence among humans for the years 2000-2021. The considered explanatory variables \
  \ include the annual mean temperature, the annual mean precipitation, the maximum of monthly mean temperatures, the maximum of \
  \ monthly mean precipitations, and the human density. We approximate the seasonal patterns characterizing the mosquito density \
  \ with a modulation function of local temperature and precipitation records, by assuming that an increase in the adult abundance \
  \ occurs as a consequence of persisting favorable conditions over a certain period. The model is informed with adult capture data \
  \ collected at different times across different locations of the US. Once calibrated, the model produces daily estimates of the \
  \ relative abundance of female adults in any geographical area of interest. Obtained estimates were combined with the probability \
  \ of disease occurrence to estimate the expected cumulative number of neuroinvasive cases in each US county at the end of 2022. \
  \ In particular, we assume that in the counties reporting a sustained disease transmission, the number of WNV cases is proportional \
  \ to the expected maximum number of mosquitoes. The model is calibrated through an MCMC approach applied to the Negative binomial \
  \ likelihood of observing the actual cumulative number of cases observed between 2012 and 2021."
